```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# 1. Create a data frame using the table below.

a. Write the codes.
```{r}
Respondents <- 1:20

Sex <- c(2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2)
Fathers_Occupation <- c(1,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,1,2,1)
Persons_at_Home <- c(5,7,3,8,5,9,6,7,8,4,7,5,4,7,8,8,3,11,7,6)
Siblings_at_School <- c(6,4,4,1,2,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,5,5,2,1,2,5,3,2)
Types_of_Houses <- c(1,2,3,1,1,3,3,1,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2)

df <- data.frame(
  Respondents,
  Sex,
  Fathers_Occupation,
  Persons_at_Home,
  Siblings_at_School,
  Types_of_Houses
)

df

```

b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data
```{r}
str(df)
summary(df)
```

c. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
```{r}
mean_siblings <- mean(df$Siblings_at_School)
mean_siblings

mean_siblings == 5
```

d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions. Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
first_two <- df[1:2, ]
first_two
```

e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.
```{r}
df[c(3,5), c(2,4)]
```

f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses. Write the codes.
```{r}
types_houses <- df$Types_of_Houses
types_houses
```

g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
male_farmer <- subset(df, Sex == "Male" & Fathers_Occupation == "Farmer")
male_farmer
```

h. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.
```{r}
female_sib_ge5 <- subset(df, Sex == "Female" & Siblings_at_School >= 5)
female_sib_ge5
```

# 2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:
df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),
          Doubles=double(), Characters=character(),
          Logicals=logical(),
          Factors=factor(),
          stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
print(str(df))

a. Describe the results.
```{r}

```
